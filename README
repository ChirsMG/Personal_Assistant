### a virtual secretary to help manage your life and prioritize tasks

I am creating this application to solve a particular problem I have found with to-do list apps and storage apps like Google Keep. To-do lists don't deal with dependencies or relvent items and storage apps do not plug into to-do lists very well. The goal here is to create a web app to store items, create tasks and link tasks and items with a dependent relationship. 

The purpose here is to not think of things as a linear set of tasks but as a a list of tasks with dependencies best represented by a tree structure.  Additionally am including a way of storeing referencing materials for a given task.
